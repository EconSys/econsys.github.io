	<h1>Simulating the Workforce</h1>
	<p>
	Workforces are complex, dynamic systems. To project the evolution of current employees, our general approach is to:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Model the potential states for the next period.</li>
		<li>Use these model(s) to simulate a new state for each employee.</li>
		<li>Update any time-dependent variables and classify each employee into the appropriate model.</li>
		<li>Repeat this process for several years into the future over a large number of trials.</li>
	</ol> 
	<p>
	Employees might also be moved to different models depending on the characteristics in each year. Employees become

	Survival analysis give you time to an event such as a retirement for retirement eligible people. But it doesn't account for promotions.

	<p>
	Logistic regression can account individual and external variables such as age and the unemployment rate.

	Sex
	Unemployment rate
	Grade level

	Could we develop a huge multinomial logistic mode that predicts state changes? 
	A markov chain could be constructed, not from average probabilities, but from averages from the model. Using such an approach, one could estimate the

	Two matrices would still be necessary, one for retirement eligible employees, one for ineligible employees.
